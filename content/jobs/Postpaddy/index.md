- System Architecture: Solely architected "Campaigns," a robust email marketing engine. Designed the backend using Nest.js and BullMQ (Redis) to handle asynchronous job processing, ensuring reliable delivery and enforcing rate-limiting (throttling) to protect domain reputation.
- Complex UI Engineering: Built a sophisticated frontend experience using React, integrating Puck for a drag-and-drop email editor and React Flow for a visual marketing automation builder.
- AI & Analytics: Collaborated with AI engineers to integrate LLM capabilities, allowing users to auto-generate email copy and automation workflows. Developed a real-time analytics engine to ingest webhook events (opens, clicks) and visualize campaign performance.
- End-to-End Ownership: Managed the entire SDLC from database design to deployment, delivering a production-ready SaaS product single-handedly.
